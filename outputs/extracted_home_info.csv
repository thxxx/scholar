After three months of research, I had learned basic sampling theory, how to use Matlab to build and train a neural network, and how to identify a linear system from input-output measurements – all before I knew the definition of the Laplace transform. That early opportunity to stretch beyond my training had a tremendous influence on the evolution of my career.
